# Instructions

To use this basic example, you'll need to first configure a project with at least one feature in bullet train.

Once you've done this, you'll then need to install the latest version of the bullet train package by running:

```
pip install bullet-train
```

Then you can run:

```
python example.py
```

The script will grab some information from you such as the environment key to test with, an identifier and a feature
name. Once you've inputted those, the script will run you through all of the methods available in the bullet train
client and print the result.
